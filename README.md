# code-formatter-API

## Summary

### This is the back end for the Code Typing application I built.  

There is a single route that takes in JavaScript code snippets and returns it to the Code Typing client in a format that
can be parsed by the application and displayed in a format that is type-able.


### Built with: 
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - Puppeteer
